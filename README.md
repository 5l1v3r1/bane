"Oh, you think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING! The shadows betray you, because they belong to me!" -Bane (Dark Knight)

                                                      INTRODUCTION:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This python library is made for educationnal purposes only. Me, as the creator and developper, not responsible for any misuse for this module in any malicious activity. it is made as a tool to understand how hackers can create their tools and performe their attacks. it contains most of known attacks and exploits. it can be used to perform: DoS and DDoS attacks (all known tools are included), information gathering, scrapping proxies, crawling, google dorking, checking for vulnerabilities (sql injection (all types), xss, command execution, php code injection, FI, forced browsing...) and even more ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      SPECIAL SPEECH:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is dedicated to my mentor: Zachary Barker ( https://www.facebook.com/zachary.barker.5439 ), he was my leader and teacher through my journey in hacking world and groups, we have been through a lot together and were there in many operations when i was an active member in blackhat community but now he is dead in a hit-and-run :( . he was one of my true cyber bros:

-S0u1 ( https://www.facebook.com/S0u1.HLoTW ) : programmer and blackhat
-Vince ( https://www.facebook.com/vincelinux ) : Linux and hardware expert, social engeneering and programmer
-Zachary Barker (lulz zombie) : teams leader, anarkist, ops organizer, progammer, cyber security expert and blackhat

in the honor of all my bros and the memory of my bro zach im sharing all my personal hacking tools with public for the first time. plz use it wisely :)

now let's start some tutorials, shall we?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      TUTORIALS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I-INSTALLING THE LIBRARY AND IMPORTING:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you can use pip to do that:

pip install bane

or you can clone the project's link then run setup.py

git clone https://github.com/AlaBouali/bane
cd bane
python setup.py install

to import it you just do:

>>>import bane
>>>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II-USAGE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


this module have many incredible, useful and easy use functions that can be implemented in any project that is related to Web Application's Security.

default parameters:
logs=True (print the test's result on the screen, set to False to not display)
returning=False (return a value indicating the success (1/True) or fail (0/False) of the test)
timeout: timeout value
proxy: same way as you use "proxies" parameters in requests

1-SQL-Injection: (useful link: https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/sql-injection2/ )


let's start with a simple SQL Injection testing. there are some techniques that can tell us if the web application is vulnerable to SQL-Injection or not, there is:

-Error Based
-boolean based
-time based

here we have functions that can determinate whether the web application is vulnerable to SQL-Injection or not using the mentioned techniques.

>>>bane.sqlieb('http://example.com/index.php?id=5')#testing for Error Based SQLI

>>>bane.sqlitb('http://example.com/index.php?id=5')#testing for Time Based SQLI

>>>bane.sqlibb('http://example.com/index.php?id=5')#testing for Boolean Based SQLI

they return only 2 possible results:

0: the target is not vulnerable
1: the target is vulnerable


2-XSS: (useful link: https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/cross-site-scripting/ )


Cross-site Scripting (XSS) refers to client-side code injection attack wherein an attacker can execute malicious scripts into a legitimate website or web application. XSS occurs when a web application makes use of unvalidated or unencoded user input within the output it generates.

here we have a function to get all html inputs in any webpage and test each input one by one against this attack.

>>> 

there is a default payload which is used in case you didn't modify the "payload" paramter (set by default to: None) to any XSS payload.you can set differnet xss payloads to test everytime with possibility to use a proxy.
